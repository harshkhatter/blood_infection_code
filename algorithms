Pseudocode 

Input: Blood Report 
Output: Abstracted summary with infection and treatment

Steps to perform:
1. Perform pre-processing to convert input values as the readable values and re-duce 
the dimensionality. 

2. Extract the major features from the input values and match the input value with 
respect to the ideal parameter range; and treat this as outcome (1).

3. Use the fuzzy inference system rules on the outcome values (1). 

4. Based on the scores and the ANFIS model, the prediction of the blood infection is 
considered as outcome (2).

5. Check the outcome (2) and apply the Neuro-fuzzy system to get the approapri-ate 
treatment from experts database; this treatment string is considered as outcome (3).

6. The obtained values (2) and (3) are shown to the users on interface as final out-put
